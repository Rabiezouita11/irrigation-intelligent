🚀 **Excited to Share My Latest Project: Smart Irrigation System!** 🌱💧

I’m thrilled to unveil my recent project—a Smart Irrigation System that integrates Angular, Node.js, Firebase, and the ESP32 microcontroller. This innovative solution is designed to optimize agricultural irrigation through both manual and automatic control. 

Here’s a detailed look at the project and its features:

### 🔧 **Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database:** Firebase
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32

### 🛠️ **Key Tasks & Features:**

1. **Frontend Development (Angular) 🚀**
   - Setup Angular project
   - Implement real-time data visualization
   - User interface for manual and automatic irrigation control

2. **Backend Development (Node.js) 🛠️**
   - Set up Express.js server
   - Integrate with Firebase to store and retrieve sensor data
   - Real-time data updates using WebSockets

3. **Firebase Configuration 🔧**
   - Create and configure Firebase project
   - Set up Realtime Database for live data storage
   - Initialize Firebase SDK in both frontend and backend

4. **Sensor Integration 📡**
   - Configure ESP32 to send sensor data
   - Implement Express.js routes to handle incoming data
   - Use Firebase Admin SDK to save data

5. **System Features 🌟**
   - **Manual Mode:** Allows users to control the irrigation pump manually
   - **Automatic Mode:** Automated irrigation based on rain detection, soil moisture, and water levels
   - **Notifications & Alerts:** Real-time alerts for low water levels and insufficient soil moisture

6. **Error Handling & Testing ⚠️🧪**
   - Implement error handling in both frontend and backend
   - Test Firebase integration, ESP32 data transmission, and Angular data display

This project represents a significant step forward in smart agriculture, leveraging cutting-edge technology to make irrigation more efficient and responsive.
